# Machine-learning-and-statistics
This is a GMIT coursework folder in which I have been tasked to perform work on data sets for 

1. A look at machine learning algorithms from the scikit learn package
1a K nearest neighbours
1b Logistic Regression
1c Linear regression

Data sets used for this were Palmer penguins and wine chemistry

2. Perform Anova calculations on a chosen data set
the chose data set was looking at weight loss on 3 different diets.

The notebooks require the palmer peguinds data set to be available and the pingoin data package. Instructions on downloading of these are available in the requirements package.

Once those actions are complete the jupyter notebooks should run in full with no intervention.

### Small diary of actions

##### Week 1 
Set of of Git hub repository for the course, adding some SKlearn work I did over the summer to ensure the page is loaded correctly and I am capable of pushing and pulling between PC and Git.
##### Week 2 
Added in the 2 x jupyter notebook file and added the requirements text file.
##### Week 3
pandas notebook started , working down through the sheet making notes and playing with the different items
numpy notebook worked on, using the real python examples
##### Week 4
scikit learn started with the example from the class
scikit learn using Knearest neighbours used
##### Week 5
Nearest neighbours finished (bar tidying)
##### Week 6/7
Logistic regression and further tidying after much drama with the annoconda package, many thanks Ian.
Starting looking at the t-test work also for the ANNOVA section of the module.
##### Weeks 8,9,10
Working theough the diet data set performing prelimnary analysis on the diet data set
Assing the suitability of the Data for anova study
Perfomring the anova study on the diet v weight loss
Perfomring anova on change in diet v change in BMI
